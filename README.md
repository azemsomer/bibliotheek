# bibliotheek
This repository contains one of my more elaborate projects: the management system of a fictious library (Dutch: bibliotheek).

The back end of this library management system is a SQL database, while the functional logic to search and update this database is provided by python scripts.

Currently this project is focused on a command line program. If this works properly, I will create a GUI and a python/django-based web-interface.

The main functions of this system are:

1. to allow users to brows the catalog
2. to allow users to see and update their own data
3. to allow users to borrow and return books
4. to allow employees to update (i.e. add and remove books) the catalog and to manage membership data

Given the size of this project, it is very much a work in progress.
