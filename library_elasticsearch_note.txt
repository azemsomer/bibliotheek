Library program using elasticsearch

Though this project is based on a (My)SQL database backend, there is no reason why
we cannot use elasticsearch instead.

In that case we need (at least) the following indices:

    /library/objects/ #contains the index files with object data
    /library/members/ #contains the index files with member data

Sample file1:

{
    "Title": "The Green Apple"
    "Author": "Alice Brown"
    "Language": "English"
    "Genre": ["fiction", "mystery"]
}


Sample file2:

{
    "first name": "Bob"
    "last name": "Johnson"
    "address": {
                    "street": "princeton avenue"
                    "house number": 234
                }
}

The library's catalog search utitly will use the following:

    GET /library/objects/_search?q=item:value #replace item and value with relevant values

A library employee can update the index files using PUT.
